## 🧠 Project Philosophy

Lucidus is not just a plugin — it’s a memory-wielding, stoner-prophet bastard AI. Built for WordPress.com Business, designed for total automation with zero bullshit.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Upload `lucidus-terminal-pro` to `/wp-content/plugins/`

## 🛠️ Build Plugin Packages

Run `scripts/build_zips.sh` to generate plugin archives. The script collects the
`dead-bastard-society`, `lucidus-terminal-pro`, and `dbs-membership-core`
directories (if present) and creates ZIP files in the `dist/` folder.

```bash
./scripts/build_zips.sh
```
