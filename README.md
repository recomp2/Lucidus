## Lucidus Terminal Codex
The theme template generator uses `lucidus-template-creation-directive.json` for guidelines on building consistent terminal-style pages.

A dynamic frontend specification lives at `wp-content/dbs-library/codex/lucidus-terminal-style-codex.json`. Use the helper script `lucidus-reactor.js` to interpret user commands and apply themes in real time.

## Lucidus GPT Autobuilder
A higher-level directive file at `wp-content/dbs-library/codex/lucidus-gpt-autobuilder-directive.json` controls automated theme generation. It references the template and style codex files and defines how Lucidus should build and validate pages without further input.

## DBS Recursive Finalizer
A directive file `wp-content/dbs-library/codex/dbs-recursive-finalizer.json` outlines how to iteratively refine the Dead Bastard Society theme and plugins without breaking existing functionality. The script details error checks, logging behavior, and the final validation steps for release.
