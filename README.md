## 🗂️ AGENTS File Guidance

Codex and other automated tools will look for an `AGENTS.md` file to load
special instructions. The search always begins at the repository root. If
present, root `AGENTS.md` rules apply to the entire project. Nested
`AGENTS.md` files may further refine behavior for subdirectories, but they are
only consulted after checking the root file. When developing new modules,
place any agent directives in an `AGENTS.md` at the appropriate level so
contributors and automation know how to proceed.
